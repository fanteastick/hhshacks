Hot dogs are sandwiches. While, admittedly, traditional sandwiches have bread that's disconnected, and wraps or burritos have bread that reach 360 degrees around, the world has moved on. To be traditional is to believe that if you walked far enough you would reach the end of the world. The world keeps spinning and hot dogs have become sandwiches.
