I love waffles that are crispy and brown,
No waffle in the world could ever make me frown,
Hot and steamy on a plate,
Nothing could ever taste so great.

I then pick up my fork and knife,
Waffles are the greatest things in my life,
I cut my waffle and take a bite,
Waffles are a tasty delight,

After I have devoured all the remains,
I eaten so much I have stomach pains,
And now Iâ€™m done with the scrumptious meal,
Waffles, Waffles, are almost unreal.
